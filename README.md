## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.6.0 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Steps to Run a Next.js Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   clone it to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmraoBisht/Todo-management.git
   cd Todo-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The development server will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Build and Start the Production Server**

   If you want to run the project in production mode:

   - Build the project:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     # or
     yarn build
     ```

   - Start the production server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     # or
     yarn start
     ```

   The production server will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## Troubleshooting

- If the server doesn't start, ensure all dependencies are installed and there are no syntax errors.
- Check for issues in the logs displayed in the terminal.
- Verify that the Node.js version meets the minimum requirements.
